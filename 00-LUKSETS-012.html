<div class="s"><div id="s1">Set 12: John Prepares the Way</div></div>(Chapter 3)<a id="v1"></a>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">12</div> <span class="v">1-6</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So a few years went by, and a new ruler came to power over the Roman Empire, and his name was Tiberius. And when he had been in power for 15 years, is when this story I am about to tell you happened.</div>
<div class="p">It was the time when these four men were the govenors that Rome had appointed over the part of the world where the Jews lived. And so Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea. Herod was over Galilee. Herod's brother, Philip, was over Iturea and Trachonitis. And Lisanious was over Abiliene.</div>
<div class="p">And then the Jewish high priests in Jerusalem at the time were Annas and Caiaphas.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">And so, during this time, God spoke to John, the son of Zechariah while John was living in the desert. And so John left and went to the Jordan river valley and started traveling all around that region, giving people this washing ceremony and teaching them that the washing ceremony called for them to acknowledge hat they had failed God and to turn to Him and receive His forgiveness.</div>
<div class="p">And all of this that John was doing was very much like something God's messenger Isaiah had spoken about centuries before when he'd said, "There's someone in the desert shouting, "Get the path ready for the True King, get the road ready for him to come to us! All of the high places will be brought down, all of the low places will be filled in. The rough places will be made smooth, and the curves will be straightened out, and in this way everyone will be able to experience God's power to rescue.<span id="bookmarks1-6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks1-6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">7-8</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So when the crowds came to John to participate in the washing ceremony, he challenged them rather harshly. He said, "You guys are like a bunch of snakes slithering away from a grass fire. Do you really think that you can outrun God's punishment? What you need to do is prove by the way you live your life that you've changed. That your life is now producing fruit. Because God's ax is already at the foot of the tree, ready to chop it down. And any tree that does not produce fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire. You might think that you're safe because you're a descendant of Abraham. But that doesn't mean anything. God can turn these stones into a descendant of Abraham if we wanted to."<span id="bookmarks7-8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks7-8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">9-14</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So the crowd said, "What shall we do?"</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">And John said, "If you run into someone who doesn't have clothes, give them some of yours. Or if you find someone that doesn't have food, give them some of your food.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">There were also some government officials that were there to participate in the washing ceremony and they asked John, "What, what shall we do?" And John said, " Don't use your position to cheat people out of their money."</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">And some soldiers also came and asked John, "what about us, what shall we do?"</div>
<div class="p">And John said, "Don't use force to take money from people, and don't tell lies about people in order to get paid, but instead be happy with the money that you make."<span id="bookmarks9-14"></span></div><span id="bookmarks9-14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">15-20</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So at this time the people were anxiously waiting for the Promised King to come. And a buzz started going through the crowd that maybe John was the Promised King. And so John addressed this by saying, "The washing that I give you is just with water, but there is Someone coming, someone who I am not even good enough to be considered his slave, and He will wash you with God's Spirit and with fire. In fact He's ready to start separating the grain from the husks. And the grain He'll put in a safe place but the husks He will through into a fire that can never be put out." And so through this kind of teaching is how John gave the good news to the people.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">And at one point John started challenging Herod the governor for all of the bad things that he had been doing and for specifically for the fact that he had taken his brother's wife, Herodia and married her. And so Herod added one more thing to the list of bad things he had done and threw John into prison.</div><span id="bookmarks15-20"></span>
