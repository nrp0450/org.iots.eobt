<div class="p"><span class="v">1-6</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So after a little while, a new ruler came to power over all of the Roman Empire. And his name was Tiberius. And in the 15th year of his reign, Pontius Pilate was the governor of Judea. Herod was the governor of Galilee. Herod's brother, Philip, was governor of Trachonitis and Iturea. And Lisanious was governor of Abiliene. And the Jewish high priests in Jerusalem were named Annas and Caiaphas. And so, at this time, John, the son of Zechariah, heard God speak to him. And so he left the desert where he was living and went to the region of the Jordan river and started travelling up and down both sides of it teaching people that they needed to participate in this washing ceremony in order to show that they had turned away from all the ways that they had failed God and received God's forgiveness. And this all happened to fulfill what God's messenger Isaiah and predicted centuries before when he spoke of a man proclaiming in the desert, saying: Prepare the way for the Eternal one Get the path ready for him Clear the path of all the debris Bring down the high spots Fill in the low spots Straighten out the curves, and Make the rough spots smooth. In this way everyone will be able to experience God's power to rescue.<span id="bookmarks1-6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks1-6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">7-8</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So when the crowds came to John to participate in the washing ceremony, he challenged them rather harshly. He said, "You guys are like a bunch of snakes slithering away from a grass fire. Do you really think that you can outrun God's punishment? What you need to do is prove by the way you live your life that you've changed. That your life is now producing fruit. Because God's ax is already at the foot of the tree, ready to chop it down. And any tree that does not produce fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire. You might think that you're safe because you're a descendant of Abraham. But that doesn't mean anything. God can turn these stones into a descendant of Abraham if we wanted to."<span id="bookmarks7-8"></span></div>
