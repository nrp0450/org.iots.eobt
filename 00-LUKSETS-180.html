<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">18-0</div> <span class="v">1-11</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>One day Jesus was by the Lake of Gennesaret, which is also called the Sea of Galilee. And He was teaching people the message from God. And they were all crowding up around him to listen. And he noticed these two boats there on the edge of the water that belonged to some fisherman who were there washing out their nets.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">And He got into one of the boats and asked its owner Simon to push out a little ways from the shore. And then He sat down in the boar and kept on teaching from there. And when He finished, He told Simon, "Go out a little ways into the deep water and put down your nets and catch some fish."</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">But Simon's like, "But Rabbi, we have been working really hard all night long and we haven't caught anything.....but, since you're asking, we'll try again." And so they went out into the deep water and put down the nets. But this time they caught so many fish that the nets were starting to break. So they quick signaled to their business partners in the other boat to come and help, and they filled up both boats so full of fish that they were both starting to sink.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">And when Simon Peter sees whats happened he's just shaken to his core, and so is everybody else with him, including his business partners, James and John, who were Zebedees' sons. And he falls down on his knees in front of Jesus and he says, "Sir, please, go away from me! I am a man whose failed God!"</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">But Jesus says, "Don't be afraid, from now on you are going to be fishing for people instead of for fish!" And so when they get back to shore they leave everything there and they follow Jesus.<span id="bookmarks1-11"></span></div>
