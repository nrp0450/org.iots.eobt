<div class="c-drop">4</div> <span class="v">1-13</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So Jesus was full of the Divine Spirit and the Spirit took him away from the Jordan River out into the middle of nowhere, where Satan the Deceiver came and tempted him for 40 days. And for these 40 days Jesus didn't eat anything and by the end he was very hungry. And then the deceiver came to him and said, "If you really are God's Son, why don't you turn these rocks into bread so you can eat?" And Jesus said, "The Scriptures say we need more than just food to truly live." So then The Deceiver took him to the top of a mountain, and in an instant showed him all of the countries of the world and he said, "This can all be yours, they've all been given to me, in all of their wealth and beauty, and I can do whatever I want with them, so if you will just swear your loyalty to me I will give them to you." And Jesus said, "The Scriptures say the only one we can swear our loyalty to is the Eternal One our God." And then The Deceiver took him into the city of Jerusalem up to the highest point of the temple and said, "If you are the God's Son why don't you jump off from here, because the Scriptures say that God will send His angels and they'll catch you in their arms and you wont even hurt your foot on a rock?" And Jesus said, "The Scriptures also say, 'Do not make the Eternal One your God prove Himself.'" So after that The Deceiver left him to wait until another opportunity.<span id="bookmarks1-13"></span></div>

<div class="p"><span class="v">38</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So when Jesus left the meeting place, he went to the home of a man named Simon. And Simon's mother-in-law was there and she was very sick with a high fever. And the people there asked Jesus to heal her.<span id="bookmarks38"></span> <a id="v39"></a><span class="v">39</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So he went over to where she was and he bent over and commanded the fever to leave her. And right away it did. And so she got up and started giving food to people.<span id="bookmarks39"></span></div><span id="bookmarks39"></span><a id="v40"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">40</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And later that evening as the sun was going down people from all around started bringing their friends and relatives to Jesus to be healed. They were sick with all different kinds of diseases and when Jesus would touch them they would get better.<span id="bookmarks40"></span> <a id="v41"></a><span class="v">41</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>There were also people who were possessed by demons that were there and when Jesus commanded the demons to leave they would shout, "You are the son of God." But Jesus silenced them. He didn't want them speaking because they knew that he was the Promised King.<span id="bookmarks41"></span></div><span id="bookmarks41"></span><a id="v42"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">42</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>The next morning Jesus got up early and went out to find a place to be by himself. And the people of the village started looking everywhere for him. And when they found him, they begged him to stay with them in their village.<span id="bookmarks42"></span> <a id="v43"></a><span class="v">43</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, "I need to keep moving. I need to tell people in other places also about the Good News of how God rules in the world. That's the whole reason I've been sent."<span id="bookmarks43"></span> <a id="v44"></a><span class="v">44</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And so Jesus continued on from village to village in Judea, teaching in the Jewish meeting places.<span id="bookmarks44"></span></div>
