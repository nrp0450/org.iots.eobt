And News about him spread like wildfire all throughout the surrounding countryside. And he went into the different Jewish places of worship and taught the people. And everybody was talking about how amazing he was. So Jesus got to Nazareth, the town he'd grown up in, and on the day of worship he went to the place of worship like he normally did. And he stood up to read from the scriptures. And they gave him the scroll written by Isaiah, one of God's messengers. And he opened it up. And he found the place where it says: The Eternal One's Spirit is with me He's the one who chose me for Announcing Good News to the poor. I was sent to announce Rescue to those in a bind Sight to those who are blind The eternal One's season to show he is kind. I was sent to send out, in freedom, the ones who've been oppressed. Then Jesus rolled the scroll up and he gave it back to the attendant and he sat down to teach. And everybody was staring at him. And he said, "This scripture that you've just heard has come true today." And all the people were talking about him. And they were amazed at the things he was saying. And they were like, "But isn't this Joseph's son?" And then Jesus said, "Look, I know pretty soon you're gonna quote that proverb to me. The one that says, 'Doctor, heal yourself.' And you're gonna say, 'We've heard about all the miracles you did in Capernaum. Do those miracles here too in your own hometown." And he said, "But look, no messenger from God is accepted in his own hometown. Listen, there were lots of widows in Isarel back in the time of God's messenger Elijah when it didn't rain for three and a half years and there wasn't enough food. And Elijah wasn't sent to any of them. Instead he was sent a widow in Zeraphath in the country of Sidon. "And when God's messenger Elisha was around, there were lots of people in Israel with serious skin diseases. And none of them were cured. Just Naaman the Syrian." When the people in the meeting place heard that they were furious. And they got up and they chased Jesus out to the edge of the town up on top of the cliff that the town was built on. And they were gonna throw him off the cliff. But Jesus just kinda walked through the crowd. And he went on his way.<span id="bookmarks14-30"></span></div><span id="bookmarks14-30"></span>
