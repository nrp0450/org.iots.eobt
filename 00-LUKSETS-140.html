And for these 40 days Jesus didn't eat anything and by the end he was very hungry. And then the deceiver came to him and said, "If you really are God's Son, why don't you turn these rocks into bread so you can eat?" And Jesus said, "The Scriptures say we need more than just food to truly live." So then The Deceiver took him to the top of a mountain, and in an instant showed him all of the countries of the world and he said, "This can all be yours, they've all been given to me, in all of their wealth and beauty, and I can do whatever I want with them, so if you will just swear your loyalty to me I will give them to you." And Jesus said, "The Scriptures say the only one we can swear our loyalty to is the Eternal One our God." And then The Deceiver took him into the city of Jerusalem up to the highest point of the temple and said, "If you are the God's Son why don't you jump off from here, because the Scriptures say that God will send His angels and they'll catch you in their arms and you wont even hurt your foot on a rock?" And Jesus said, "The Scriptures also say, 'Do not make the Eternal One your God prove Himself.'" So after that The Deceiver left him to wait until another opportunity.<span id="bookmarks1-13"></span></div>
