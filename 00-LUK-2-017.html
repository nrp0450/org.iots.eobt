<div class="c-drop">17</div> <span class="v">38</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So when Jesus left the meeting place, he went to the home of a man named Simon. And Simon's mother-in-law was there and she was very sick with a high fever. And the people there asked Jesus to heal her.<span id="bookmarks38"></span> <a id="v39"></a><span class="v">39</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So he went over to where she was and he bent over and commanded the fever to leave her. And right away it did. And so she got up and started giving food to people.<span id="bookmarks39"></span></div><span id="bookmarks39"></span><a id="v40"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">40</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And later that evening as the sun was going down people from all around started bringing their friends and relatives to Jesus to be healed. They were sick with all different kinds of diseases and when Jesus would touch them they would get better.<span id="bookmarks40"></span> <a id="v41"></a><span class="v">41</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>There were also people who were possessed by demons that were there and when Jesus commanded the demons to leave they would shout, "You are the son of God." But Jesus silenced them. He didn't want them speaking because they knew that he was the Promised King.<span id="bookmarks41"></span></div><span id="bookmarks41"></span><a id="v42"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">42</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>The next morning Jesus got up early and went out to find a place to be by himself. And the people of the village started looking everywhere for him. And when they found him, they begged him to stay with them in their village.<span id="bookmarks42"></span> <a id="v43"></a><span class="v">43</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, "I need to keep moving. I need to tell people in other places also about the Good News of how God rules in the world. That's the whole reason I've been sent."<span id="bookmarks43"></span> <a id="v44"></a><span class="v">44</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And so Jesus continued on from village to village in Judea, teaching in the Jewish meeting places.</div><span id="bookmarks44"></span>
