<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">4</div> <span class="v">1-13</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So Jesus was full of the Divine Spirit and the Spirit took him away from the Jordan River out into the middle of nowhere, where Satan the Deceiver came and tempted him for 40 days. And for these 40 days Jesus didn't eat anything and by the end he was very hungry. And then the deceiver came to him and said, "If you really are God's Son, why don't you turn these rocks into bread so you can eat?" And Jesus said, "The Scriptures say we need more than just food to truly live." So then The Deceiver took him to the top of a mountain, and in an instant showed him all of the countries of the world and he said, "This can all be yours, they've all been given to me, in all of their wealth and beauty, and I can do whatever I want with them, so if you will just swear your loyalty to me I will give them to you." And Jesus said, "The Scriptures say the only one we can swear our loyalty to is the Eternal One our God." And then The Deceiver took him into the city of Jerusalem up to the highest point of the temple and said, "If you are the God's Son why don't you jump off from here, because the Scriptures say that God will send His angels and they'll catch you in their arms and you wont even hurt your foot on a rock?" And Jesus said, "The Scriptures also say, 'Do not make the Eternal One your God prove Himself.'" So after that The Deceiver left him to wait until another opportunity.<span id="bookmarks1-13"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Set 15 - Jesus rejected in Nazareth</div></div><span id="bookmarks1-13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">14-30</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went back to the Galilee region, full of the power of God's Spririt. And News about him spread like wildfire all throughout the surrounding countryside. And he went into the different Jewish places of worship and taught the people. And everybody was talking about how amazing he was. So Jesus got to Nazareth, the town he'd grown up in, and on the day of worship he went to the place of worship like he normally did. And he stood up to read from the scriptures. And they gave him the scroll written by Isaiah, one of God's messengers. And he opened it up. And he found the place where it says: The Eternal One's Spirit is with me He's the one who chose me for Announcing Good News to the poor. I was sent to announce Rescue to those in a bind Sight to those who are blind The eternal One's season to show he is kind. I was sent to send out, in freedom, the ones who've been oppressed. Then Jesus rolled the scroll up and he gave it back to the attendant and he sat down to teach. And everybody was staring at him. And he said, "This scripture that you've just heard has come true today." And all the people were talking about him. And they were amazed at the things he was saying. And they were like, "But isn't this Joseph's son?" And then Jesus said, "Look, I know pretty soon you're gonna quote that proverb to me. The one that says, 'Doctor, heal yourself.' And you're gonna say, 'We've heard about all the miracles you did in Capernaum. Do those miracles here too in your own hometown." And he said, "But look, no messenger from God is accepted in his own hometown. Listen, there were lots of widows in Isarel back in the time of God's messenger Elijah when it didn't rain for three and a half years and there wasn't enough food. And Elijah wasn't sent to any of them. Instead he was sent a widow in Zeraphath in the country of Sidon. "And when God's messenger Elisha was around, there were lots of people in Israel with serious skin diseases. And none of them were cured. Just Naaman the Syrian." When the people in the meeting place heard that they were furious. And they got up and they chased Jesus out to the edge of the town up on top of the cliff that the town was built on. And they were gonna throw him off the cliff. But Jesus just kinda walked through the crowd. And he went on his way.</div><span id="bookmarks14-30"></span>

<div class="p"><span class="v">38-44</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So when Jesus left the meeting place, he went to the home of a man named Simon. And Simon's mother-in-law was there and she was very sick with a high fever. And the people there asked Jesus to heal her. So he went over to where she was and he bent over and commanded the fever to leave her. And right away it did. And so she got up and started giving food to people. And later that evening as the sun was going down people from all around started bringing their friends and relatives to Jesus to be healed. They were sick with all different kinds of diseases and when Jesus would touch them they would get better. There were also people who were possessed by demons that were there and when Jesus commanded the demons to leave they would shout, "You are the son of God." But Jesus silenced them. He didn't want them speaking because they knew that he was the Promised King. The next morning Jesus got up early and went out to find a place to be by himself. And the people of the village started looking everywhere for him. And when they found him, they begged him to stay with them in their village. But Jesus said, "I need to keep moving. I need to tell people in other places also about the Good News of how God rules in the world. That's the whole reason I've been sent." And so Jesus continued on from village to village in Judea, teaching in the Jewish meeting places.<span id="bookmarks38-44"></span></div><span id="bookmarks38-44"></span><span id="bookmarks38-44"></span>
