<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">3</div> <span class="v">1-6</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So after a little while, a new ruler came to power over all of the Roman Empire. And his name was Tiberius. And in the 15th year of his reign, Pontius Pilate was the governor of Judea. Herod was the governor of Galilee. Herod's brother, Philip, was governor of Trachonitis and Iturea. And Lisanious was governor of Abiliene. And the Jewish high priests in Jerusalem were named Annas and Caiaphas. And so, at this time, John, the son of Zechariah, heard God speak to him. And so he left the desert where he was living and went to the region of the Jordan river and started travelling up and down both sides of it teaching people that they needed to participate in this washing ceremony in order to show that they had turned away from all the ways that they had failed God and received God's forgiveness. And this all happened to fulfill what God's messenger Isaiah and predicted centuries before when he spoke of a man proclaiming in the desert, saying: Prepare the way for the Eternal one Get the path ready for him Clear the path of all the debris Bring down the high spots Fill in the low spots Straighten out the curves, and Make the rough spots smooth. In this way everyone will be able to experience God's power to rescue.<span id="bookmarks1-6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks1-6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">7-8</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So when the crowds came to John to participate in the washing ceremony, he challenged them rather harshly. He said, "You guys are like a bunch of snakes slithering away from a grass fire. Do you really think that you can outrun God's punishment? What you need to do is prove by the way you live your life that you've changed. That your life is now producing fruit. Because God's ax is already at the foot of the tree, ready to chop it down. And any tree that does not produce fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire. You might think that you're safe because you're a descendant of Abraham. But that doesn't mean anything. God can turn these stones into a descendant of Abraham if he wanted to."<span id="bookmarks7-8"></span> <a id="v9"></a><span class="v">9-14</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So the crowd said, "What shall we do?" And John said, "If you run into someone who doesn't have clothes, give them some of yours. Or if you find someone that doesn't have food, give them some of your food. There were also some government officials that were there to participate in the washing ceremony and they asked John, "What, what shall we do?" And John said, " Don't use your position to cheat people out of their money." And some soldiers also came and asked John, "what about us, what shall we do?" And John said, "Don't use force to take money from people, and don't tell lies about people in order to get paid, but instead be happy with the money that you make."<span id="bookmarks9-14"></span> <a id="v15"></a><span class="v">15-20</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So at this time the people were anxiously waiting for the Promised King to come. And a buzz started going through the crowd that maybe John was the Promised King. And so John addressed this by saying, "The washing that I give you is just with water, but there is Someone coming, someone who I am not even good enough to be considered his slave, and He will wash you with God's Spirit and with fire. In fact He's ready to start separating the grain from the husks. And the grain He'll put in a safe place but the husks He will through into a fire that can never be put out." And so through this kind of teaching is how John gave the good news to the people. And at one point John started challenging Herod the governor for all of the bad things that he had been doing and for specifically for the fact that he had taken his brother's wife, Herodia and married her. And so Herod added one more thing to the list of bad things he had done and threw John into prison.<span id="bookmarks15-20"></span></div>
