<div class="s"><div id="s1">Set 26: The Roman Army Officer</div></div>(Chapter 7)<a id="v1"></a>
<div class="m">
<div class="c-drop">26-0</div> <span class="v">1</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>When Jesus finished teaching he left and went to the town of Capernaum.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a><span class="v">2</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And in Capernaum at the time, there was a certain Roman officer that was stationed there. And this guy had a servant in his household that was very sick. Like almost to the point of dying. And he really cared about him.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a><span class="v">3</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And so when he heard that Jesus was in town, he got some Jewish leaders that he knew to go and see if they could get Jesus to come and heal his servant.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a><span class="v">4</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And so the leaders went and they found Jesus and begged him to come and heal the servant. They said, "If anybody deserves for you to do this for 'em, it's this officer, this Roman officer.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a><span class="v">5</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>He really loves our people and he even built a place of worship for us."<span id="bookmarks5"></span></div><span id="bookmarks5"></span><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">6</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So Jesus agreed and started going with them to the officer's house. And when they were almost there, the officer sent some of his friends out with a message for Jesus. And in the message he said, "Sir, it's really not necessary for you to come to my house. I'm not important enough to have you in my house.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a><span class="v">7</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>And that's also why I didn't come see you. Because I'm not important enough.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a><span class="v">8</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>But I know that if you just give the command where you are, my servant will be healed. I know this because I have superior officers over me. And I have soldiers that report to me. And if I tell one to go, he goes. If I tell another one to come. He comes. If I tell a servant to do something, he does it. So if you'll just give the command, my servant will be healed."<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="v">9</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard this he was amazed. He turned around to the people that were following and he said, "Wow, even among all of the Jewish people I haven't found anyone that trusts me like this."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a><span class="v">10</span><span class="vsp">&nbsp;</span>So then the men that had come turned around and went back to the officer's house and when they got there they discovered that the servant was healed.<span id="bookmarks10"></span></div><span id="bookmarks10"></span>
